::  tonic: an automatic sail refresher
::
::    when used in conjunction with gin, provides a refreshing way to do
::    sail development. tonic works by augmenting your agent with a
::    subscription endpoint that provides the current desk commit.
::
::    the included $inject gate will add a script into your sail page
::    that will watch for new desk commits and refresh the page if it
::    receives a new commit.
